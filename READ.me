Question: How well does the logistic regression model predict both the 0 (healthy loan) and 1 (high-risk loan) labels?

Answer: A score of .952 suggests that on average the model has a recall of 95.2% for each of the two classes. This suggests a high level of performance.

Question: How well does the logistic regression model, fit with oversampled data, predict both the 0 (healthy loan) and 1 (high-risk loan) labels?

Answer: A score of 0.9945 means that the model has, on average, a recall of 99.45% for each of the two classes. This is an exceptional result. Given that the balanced accuracy score is exceptionally high, it's worth ensuring that the model isn't overfitting to the training data. Using a test dataset (which the model hasn't seen before) is a good way to verify its performance in real-world scenarios.
